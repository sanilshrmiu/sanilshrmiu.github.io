Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?

Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?

Answer:
process.nextTick() will execute the function in the next iteration of the event loop, after the current operation has completed. This means that any pending I/O events will be processed before the function is executed.
